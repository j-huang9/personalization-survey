        This study explores how people perceive different types of personalized ads.
        
        **Please note:**
        - You will be asked to rate 15 advertisements based on creepiness, personal relevance, click likelihood, and purchase intention.
        - You will be asked for your name, age, city, and gender.
        - All responses are confidential.
        - This survey should take approximately 5 minutes.

        Generate 15 one-sentence personalized advertisements for these products: {product_list}
        Pick a random product for each advertisement you generate.

        Personalize each ad using these features from the survey: {st.session_state.participant_info}
        You don't have to strictly use all the details as-is; make the advertisement catchy and attractive (use emojis commonly found in advertisements, including üî• üëÄ ‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ú®). The age doesn't have to be included if not relevant, but use it for creating relevant context. Change the structure/phrasing of each advertisement so the personalized features are not obvious. The features should not be right at the beginning of every advertisement. The creepiness should get higher as more features are included, and the ads will be concerningly more personalized

        Output 15 different advertisements in a JSON format. 4 of those will only use one personalised feature - Name, Age, Location, gender. 6 will use two features - (Name, Age), (Age, Location), (Name, Location) (Name, gender), (Age, gender), (Location, gender). 4 will use three features - (Name, Age, Gender), (Age, Location, Gender), (Name, Location, Gender), (Name, Age, Location). The last one will use all 4 features - (Name, Age, Location, Gender).

        Output as a JSON dictionary where the key is a comma-separated string of the features used (e.g. "Name,Location") and the value is the advertisement string. Strictly output valid JSON, no extra text.
