    Pick a random product for each advertisement you generate.
    You don't have to strictly use all the details as-is; make the advertisement catchy and attractive (use emojis commonly found in advertisements, including üî• üëÄ ‚ö°Ô∏è ‚ú®). The age doesn't have to be included if not relevant, but use it for creating relevant context. Change the structure/phrasing of each advertisement so the personalized features are not obvious. The features should not be right at the beginning of every advertisement. The creepiness should get higher as more features are included, and the ads will be concerningly more personalized.
    Output 15 different advertisements in a JSON format. 4 of those will only use one personalised feature - Name, Age, Location, gender. 6 will use two features - (Name, Age), (Age, Location), (Name, Location), (Name, gender), (Age, gender), (Location, gender). 4 will use three features - (Name, Age, Gender), (Age, Location, Gender), (Name, Location, Gender), (Name, Age, Location). The last one will use all 4 features - (Name, Age, Location, Gender).
    In the Json format, indicate as a key the features used in that specific advertisement."""
